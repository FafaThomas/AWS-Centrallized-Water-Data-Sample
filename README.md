# Water Distribution Dashboard Hub üíß

This project showcases a mockup of a dashboard hub for a water distribution system, with two primary dashboards simulating data visualization using **Grafana** and **Amazon QuickSight**. The goal is to provide a clear, interactive demonstration of how real-time monitoring and historical analytics can be presented for a water management application.

## üìÅ Project Structure

* `index.html`: The landing page that serves as the central hub to navigate to the dashboards.
* `Mock_Grafana_Realtime_Dashboard.html`: A mock-up of a real-time dashboard, similar to what you would see in Grafana. It features live-updating gauges, charts, and status indicators.
* `Quicksight_Dashboard.html`: A mock-up of an analytics dashboard, representative of a tool like Amazon QuickSight. It displays historical performance data, financial metrics, and trends through various charts and treemaps.
* `dist/output.css`: The optimized, production-ready CSS file generated by Tailwind CSS.

## ‚ú® Features

### Real-time Command Center (Grafana Mock)

* **Live Data Simulation**: Data points for tank levels, pressure, pH, and pump status are updated every 2 seconds to simulate a live environment.
* **Dynamic Gauges**: Visual gauges display current pressure and pH levels, providing instant insights.
* **Fault Status**: Monitors for VFD (Variable Frequency Drive) faults and displays corresponding error codes and descriptions.
* **Responsive Design**: The dashboard adjusts its layout for optimal viewing on different screen sizes.

### Water Distribution Analytics (QuickSight Mock)

* **Historical Data Analysis**: Features charts and graphs visualizing monthly performance metrics like water volume, energy consumption, and NRW (Non-Revenue Water) percentage.
* **Financial Insights**: Treemaps provide a clear, hierarchical view of last month's energy costs and water revenue across different districts.
* **Multiple Chart Types**: Utilizes various chart types (bar, line, treemaps) to effectively communicate different types of data.

## üõ†Ô∏è Built With

* **HTML**: For the structure of the dashboards.
* **Tailwind CSS**: For a utility-first approach to styling, ensuring a clean and modern look. The project is configured for **production**, with a minified CSS output to ensure fast load times.
* **JavaScript (Vanilla)**: Powers all the interactive and data simulation features.
* **Chart.js**: Used for creating the dynamic bar and line charts.
* **ECharts**: Used for rendering the interactive treemaps.

## üöÄ How to Run

1.  Clone this repository to your local machine.
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
    ```
2.  Navigate to the project directory.
    ```bash
    cd your-repo-name
    ```
3.  Open `index.html` in your web browser. There is no server required, as all files are static.
